## Introduction

The News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System is a web-based application that analyzes news articles to determine their truthfulness and maps the results to planets in our solar system. The system uses the metaphor that less truthful articles are "further from the truth" (the Sun), creating an engaging and intuitive way to visualize news credibility. Users can submit news articles and receive both a truthfulness assessment and a corresponding planet assignment.

## Glossary

- **News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System**: The complete web application that analyzes news articles and assigns them to planets based on truthfulness
- **Truthfulness Score**: A numerical value between 0 and 1 indicating how truthful an article is (1 being completely truthful)
- **Planet Assignment**: The specific planet in the solar system that corresponds to the article's truthfulness level
- **Solar System Mapping**: The algorithm that maps truthfulness scores to the eight planets plus Pluto, ordered by distance from the Sun
- **Article Analysis Engine**: The component that processes news text and determines its truthfulness using machine learning
- **Planetary Visualization**: The visual representation showing the assigned planet with contextual information

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit a news article for analysis, so that I can see how truthful it is represented as a planet in the solar system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a news article through the web interface, THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL analyze the article and return results within 10 seconds
2. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL accept article text with a minimum length of 50 characters and maximum length of 10,000 characters

5. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL handle multiple concurrent article submissions without performance degradation

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my article's truthfulness represented as a planet, so that I can intuitively understand how credible the news is.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL assign articles to planets based on truthfulness scores using the mapping: Sun (1.0), Mercury (0.89-0.99), Venus (0.78-0.88), Earth (0.67-0.77), Mars (0.56-0.66), Jupiter (0.45-0.55), Saturn (0.34-0.44), Uranus (0.23-0.33), Neptune (0.12-0.22), Pluto (0.0-0.11)
2. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL display the assigned planet with a visual representation and descriptive text
3. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL show the exact truthfulness score alongside the planet assignment
4. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL provide contextual information about why the article received its specific planet assignment
5. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL include educational content about each planet's characteristics related to the truthfulness metaphor

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to understand what makes an article more or less truthful, so that I can better evaluate news sources in the future.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL provide analysis insights explaining key factors that influenced the truthfulness assessment
2. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL highlight specific text segments that contributed to higher or lower truthfulness scores
3. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL offer educational tips about identifying reliable news sources and fact-checking techniques
4. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL display confidence levels for the analysis to help users understand the reliability of the assessment
5. THE News Truthfulness Planetary Mapping System SHALL provide links to fact-checking resources and media literacy guides

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want an engaging and intuitive web interface, so that analyzing news articles feels educational and enjoyable rather than technical.
