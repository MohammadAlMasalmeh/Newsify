# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Fake News Detection System is a web-based application that analyzes news articles to determine their authenticity using machine learning. The system leverages a pretrained Hugging Face model to classify news text as either "FAKE" or "REAL" with confidence scores, providing users with an automated tool to assess news credibility.

## Glossary

- **Fake News Detection System**: The complete web application that analyzes news text authenticity
- **Classification Pipeline**: The Hugging Face transformers pipeline that processes text and returns predictions
- **Prediction Endpoint**: The FastAPI REST endpoint that accepts news text and returns classification results
- **Confidence Score**: A numerical value between 0 and 1 indicating the model's certainty in its prediction
- **News Text**: The input article content or headline to be analyzed for authenticity

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to submit news text for analysis, so that I can determine if the content is likely fake or real.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user sends a POST request to the `/predict` endpoint with valid JSON containing news text, THE Fake News Detection System SHALL return a classification result within 5 seconds
2. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL accept JSON requests with the exact format `{"text": "<news text here>"}`
3. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL validate that the input text is not empty and contains at least 10 characters
4. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL return HTTP status 400 for invalid or malformed requests
5. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL return HTTP status 200 for successful predictions

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to receive clear classification results with confidence levels, so that I can understand how certain the system is about its prediction.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL return predictions in the exact JSON format `{"label": "FAKE" or "REAL", "score": confidence score as float}`
2. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL ensure the label field contains only the values "FAKE" or "REAL"
3. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL provide confidence scores as float values between 0.0 and 1.0
4. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL round confidence scores to 4 decimal places for consistency
5. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL include both label and score fields in every successful response

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to use a pretrained model without retraining, so that I can quickly deploy the system without machine learning expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL load the pretrained model from "Pulk17/Fake-News-Detection" on Hugging Face
2. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL use the transformers library pipeline for text classification
3. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL initialize the model once during application startup
4. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL NOT perform any model training or fine-tuning operations
5. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL handle model loading errors gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a clean and modular FastAPI backend, so that I can easily maintain and extend the system with frontend integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL implement a FastAPI application with proper structure and organization
2. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL separate model loading logic from API endpoint logic
3. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL include proper error handling for all API operations
4. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL provide clear API documentation through FastAPI's automatic documentation
5. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL be ready for frontend integration without requiring backend modifications

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear instructions for running the system locally, so that I can quickly set up and test the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL include documentation for installing required dependencies
2. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL provide uvicorn command instructions for local server startup
3. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL specify the correct host and port configuration for local development
4. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL include example API usage with sample requests and responses
5. THE Fake News Detection System SHALL document any environment setup requirements
