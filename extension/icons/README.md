# Extension Icons

To complete the Chrome extension, you'll need to add icon files:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store)

You can create these icons with any image editor. They should feature your Newsify logo or a cosmic/space theme to match your website design.

For now, you can use placeholder icons or create simple ones with the following characteristics:
- Dark space background with stars
- A magnifying glass or detector symbol
- The Newsify logo/text
- Cosmic colors (purples, blues, etc.)

Alternatively, you can use online icon generators or find suitable icons from free icon libraries like:
- Flaticon
- Icons8  
- Feather Icons
- Material Design Icons

Make sure the icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes!
